# Saad's Portfolio
## For whom it may concern...
My name is Saad Syed and I am an engineer. I have proficient skills in HTML, CSS, as well as Javascript.
I am farily new to the world of coding, but my work speaks for itself. This website contains a small section about me, links to my work, as well as contact information.
Consider this portfolio as another example of the skills I bring to a workforce.
